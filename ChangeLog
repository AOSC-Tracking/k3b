Show writer buffer state in addition to fifo buffer when writing CDs.
Show device buffer state for DVD writing (does not work always yet)
Fixed read and save setting in VideoCD project.
Big parts of the audio project have been rewritten to have a way better design:
	- K3b now does not create additional silence between the tracks by default
          the pregap is treated as part of the previous track like in all other
          writing applications.
        - Instead it's possible to add additional silence manually to a track.
        - Allow multible sources for one track.
        - Split tracks, merge tracks.
        - Improved track dialog.
K3b now always writes a logfile in $(KDEHOME)/share/apps/k3b/lastlog.log

Fixed the docking issues. No floating dock windows anymore. :) I have no idea why I wasn't able to do this 
	before... it was so easy after all.
Plugin based Audio Output system for Audio project "preview".
Dropped id3lib in favor of TagLib (great work Scott :)
When the speed for an on-the-fly audio project is set to "Auto" K3b now determines the max writing speed.
Do not close dialogs after the action is done (for example cd copy)
Directly copy Audio tracks from an Audio CD to an Audio project.
Session management
Made K3b a unique application only allowing one instance.
Improved dcop interface for data projects which allows to add and remove items 
	to and from specific folders in the project.
Conditional audio ripping pattern. Now what does that mean? It means that you can do stuff like:
	"if the track has a genre encoded use it, otherwise use 'misc'" and stuff like that.
New project plugin interface. Example: the audio project cddb plugin is now a project plugin
MusicBrainz support (Query audio file tags over the internet)
K3b now has a "smart" automatic multisession handling in Data projects.
Replaced the system tray by an OSD inspired by the one in amaroK
Better symlink handling with proper size information if "follow symlinks" is activated.
HAL support (turn on your USB writer while K3b is running and see it getting detected automatically)
eMovix 0.9.0 support

0.11.25
Do not discard broken symlinks if not explicitely requested by the user.
Fixed crash when cancelling data verification during reloading of media.
	
0.11.24

accidently overwriting the rewritable source DVD)
Fixed problem with very slow data verification (the progress was updated way too often) (thanks to Simon)
BACKPORT: support for newer transcode versions.
Mp3-decoder plugin handles errors in mp3 files better now.

0.11.23
Fixed session import.
Fixed seldom crash in the welcome widget.
	
0.11.22

Made multisession selection in DVD project visible.
Fixed crash when importing session failed.
Fixed compilation with flac 1.1.2

0.11.20
Fixed handling of -xa and -xa1 options for dvd patched cdrecord versions in which case K3b
	had problems with the -dvd suffix in the version string.

0.11.19
Finally fixed mp3 file detection (I feared I was never going to find the problem)
Fixed bug which made the DataDvdJob delete an image even if none was created.
Fixed bug which made the iso image verification fail when writing in TAO mode.
Fixed crash when no DVD writer is present.
	
0.11.18
Fixed Cd-Text loading in audio projects.
Fixed data project character restrictions.

K3bSetup now removes the suid root bit on kernel 2.6.8 an above systems.
K3bSetup now also sets the proper permissions on the generic devices.
Fixed handling of boot load segment 0 for "none-emulation" boo images

0.11.17
Fixed some DVD writing speed detection issues.
Always write pure Data CDs in TAO mode when using cdrecord since DAO fails on so many
	writers. There should not be any drawback.
Properly restrict the charset everywhere a file in a data project can be renamed.
	
0.11.16
Open the device read-only in case opening read/write failes.

0.11.15
Fixed writer detection issues with kernel >= 2.6.8 (this only means that K3b now openes the device
	read/write when issuing the MODE SELECT command. Nothing more. Tests with kernel 2.6.9-rc2
	on my system still produced problems)
Fixed Sox encoder plugin.
Fixed editing range for audio track length.

0.11.14
QT 3.1 compile fix (I keep forgetting these...)
Fixed ID3V2 Tag size calculation. This fixes mp3 file detection for some files.

0.11.13

BACKPORT: DVD+R Double Layer writing.
Properly close a DVD when the user did not want multisession.
Properly find dvd+rw-format version >= 4.10.

	totally bogus raw data.

0.11.12
Another qt 3.1 compile fix
Mkisofs 2.02 obsoletes the use of -L, -H, and -P. Replaced them by the long versions.
Fixed GET PERFORMANCE command which caused crashes on some systems and DMA problems on other.
Default to RAW writing mode for Audio CDs which contain zero length pregaps since there are
    so many buggy CD writers out there failing to create proper CDs in that case.
Backported new device configuration format fixing all issues with removable devices (USB,...)
Fix: Some writers return the number of bytes instead of the number of write speed descriptors
     in mode page 2a data (thanks to <simon@munton.demon.co.uk>)
Fixed a bug which caused the audio ripping window to stay greyed out if cddb queries are disabled.

Improved ~ handling in the QuickDirSelector.
Save/Load composer fields in audio projects
Save/Load default DVD Copy reading device
	
0.11.9
Fixed data project size calculation (for good this time).
	
0.11.8
K3b now searches for the Debian cdrecord wrapper script and properly selects the cdrecord version to use
	(cdrecord.mmap or cdrecord.shm) based on the kernel version. This should fix all problems with
	K3bSetup on Debian.
Fixed writing speed parsing with patched cdrecord
Add leading zero to tracknumber meta data field when encoding audio tracks.
Fixed data project size calculation if files from different devices have the same inode number.
It is now possible to enter hexadecimal values in the boot image load segment fields.
Fixed external program encoder plugin (this includes lame and flac encoding)

0.11.7
Check size of returned CD-TEXT data to be a multiple of the pack length. This should fix problems
	with CD copy.
Audio Project: Do not overwrite CD-Text values loaded from the project file with the ones detected.
Added --copydvd command line parameter
Do only read MCN and ISRCs when copying an audio cd since scanning them takes a very long time.

Use a default imagefile name for cloning if none was specified.
Use the Joliet names if no Rockridge is available in session import
	
0.11.3
fixed features detection with some devices.
fixed multisession writing on some systems (K3b used to open the device instead of leaving it to mkisofs to
	prevent permission problems. Sadly this does not work with all systems since it seems that K3b does
	not close the device early enough so cdrecord cannot open it.)

0.11.2
K3bProcess now has a clean API and a non-stupid implementation which fixes the kde 3.2 issue
way better than the hotfix from 0.11.1.
Fixed a crash at K3b start which happened with ROM drives that return zero length modepage 0x05 data.
fixed onthefly DVD copy issues
K3b now uses the internal reader for DVD copy instead of readcd
added read retries and "ignore read error" options to the dvd copy dialog
fixed handling of empty raw toc data
fixed the bug that made K3b try to use cdrdao for DVD iso image writing.
add files to a project by dropping them on the corresponding tab
removed the "query cddb" option from the copy dialog since this is configured globally anyway.
fixed loading of VideoDVD projects
Fixed VideoDVD project with a HACK. mkisofs is not able to create a VideoDVD using graft-points which
	is the default in K3b. So now K3b links all VIDEO_TS files in a temp directory.
	
0.11.1
fixed an issue introduced with KDE 3.2rc1 which caused on-the-fly data writing to fail all the time.
  (If you need to know: For some reason KProcess makes the Stdin fd O_NONBLOCK. This way mkisofs is
   not  able to write properly to cdrecord's stdin anymore.)

0.11
fixed libcdparanoia-loading on Debian (and maybe some other systems)
fixed crash at end of image creation in DVD project
fixed filesize display for very large files and projects (integer overflow)
fixed CD-TEXT reading. On some systems some senseless characters where appended.
fixed Id3lib detection in configure.in.in
added primitive supermount support
kernel 2.5 compile fixes (thanks to ismail (cartman) d�mez <ismail.donmez@boun.edu.tr>)
K3b now defaults to the generic-mmc cdrdao driver if the used burner is not listed in 
	cdrdao's driver table. As all modern drives use the generic-mmc driver anyway this
	is valid and prevents from a lot of newbie problems.
Added a thememanager and the new crystal look by Everaldo
K3b does not mount the disk for session import or data verification anymore. This way supermount
	users will have no problems.
merged cue/bin and isoimage burning in one dialog which provides image-type-detection
	supported so far: iso, cue, cdrdao toc, cdrecord clone images
better systemconfigcheck messages when cdrecord is not running with root privs
proper automatic writing mode and writing app selection for non-DAO-capable writers
overwriting of files in a new session
default CD size is now 80 min

FLAC decoding plugin (thanks to John Steele Scott)
check if a DVD-R(W) writer supports incremental streaming before trying multisession
check if a DVD-R(W) writer supports testwriting before trying a simulation
fixed DVD-Copy. We needed to determine the size of the data to copy for ourselves instead of relying
	on the kernel
Automatic CD-writing speed selection (chooses always the max for now)
Technical info about audiofiles in the audio project are displayed in the track properties dialog
One may now add complete dirs to an audio project
Detection of Justlink support
Finally the device handling is completely independant. No calls to cdrecord anymore. That's why we
now have a libk3bdevice.
Improved writing speed estimation for audio tracks.
Added a button which determines the supported writing speeds with the mounted media. this way it is possible
	to also select dvd writing speeds other than 1x
fixed directory sorting in iso filesystems
fixed boot image file sorting
Joliet long support (103 chars joliet filenames)
improved meta tag handling for audio encoding, support for album title and stuff
fixed crash when only creating images without an installed cd writer
writing speed is loaded correctly again
Completely rewritten CD copy:
   - Copy Audio, multisession and Mixed mode CDs.

DVD formatting
DVD Copy (pure data dvd copy without any video transcoding)
CD Cloning with cdrtools >= 2.01a17
device capabilities detection without cdrecord. This solves the long startup problem with ATAPI devices.
moved audio ripping pattern configuration from options dialog to audio ripping dialog
option to automatically erase CD-RWs and DVD-RWs without asking before writing
dragging files from a data project to the audio player (basically it's just a KURLDrag so it may be dragged
	everywhere)
K3b is now divided in three libs and the main application: libk3bcore, libk3btools, and libk3bproject
	this makes creating KParts-plugins easy. Two examples can be found in the tests/kpartplugins dir
	one of them is a former K3b option which allowed to use audio meta data to rename files while
	adding them to a data project. Now this is done by a plugin and a much higher degree of user 
	interaction.
Iso9660 file sorting (mkisofs -sort)
libid3 support for better mp3 tag access (we had that in some very old version but back then
	K3b depended on it. Now it defaults to using KFileMetaInfo if it's not available)
Pluggable audio decoding
Pluggable audio encoding and completely rewritten audio ripping
	much faster now due to a much better threading
Check for read permission when adding files to a project
file filter in binimagewritingdialog and isoimagewritingdialog (thanx to David Maciejak)
Verification of written data (compares md5 sums of all written files).
K3bSetup is not longer compiled unless explicit activated (K3bSetup is outdated and K3bSetup2 is still not ready)
K3b now also compiles without aRts. In this case the audioplayer will be useless (but still there)
no need for special mkisofs permissons anymore. K3b now openes the device itself when importing
	an old session.
added a little color animation when dropping files onto a directory in data projects
	it is always hard to tell if one dropped on the correct dir. If some one has a better animation 
	I would be interested in replacing this simple one.
Added CD-TEXT reading (used for Audio CD ripping)
sox encoder plugin to encode to all audio formats supported by sox (will anyone ever use this??)
encoder plugin that let's you specify a commandline to encode the data. Typical example would be calling lame to
	encode to mp3.
much better TOC reading. K3b now displays multisession info.
m3u Playlist creation for ripped audio files
replaced the old K3bSetup with a quite simple KControl Module which is only able to change the
	needed permission for devices and external programs. Everything else is nowadays done
	by the distros.

   fixed load and saveUserDefaults
   fixed autodetection VCD Typ (now the user can turn off this feature)
