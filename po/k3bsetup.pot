"<ol>\n"
"<li>Make sure your kernel supports SCSI emulation, at least as a module. If "

"case. Try loading the module with <pre>modprobe ide-scsi</pre> as root. If "
"your kernel does not support SCSI emulation you need to build your own "
"kernel, or at least a module. Unfortunately that goes beyond the scope of "
"this documentation.</li>\n"
"<li>If your kernel supports SCSI emulation as a module it is recommended to "
"add an entry in /etc/modules.conf so that the module is loaded "
"automatically. Otherwise you have to load it with <pre>modprobe ide-scsi</"
"pre> every time you need it.\n"
"</li>\n"
"<li>The last step is to inform the kernel that you are about to use SCSI "
"emulation at boot time. If you are using lilo (which is highly recommended), "
"you need to add <pre>append = \"hdc=ide-scsi hdd=ide-scsi\"</pre> to your /"
"etc/lilo.conf and re-run lilo as root to install the new configuration.\n"
"After rebooting your system, your CD writer is ready for action.</li>\n"
