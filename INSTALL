Installing K3b 0.9
------------------


Before installing K3b please make sure you have at least the following installed on your system:
 - the QT3 library (at least version 3.1)
 - the KDE3 libraries (at least version 3.1)
 


After that it's all the same:

./configure

or try ./configure --help to learn about the options.
Mostly you will like to set the kde3 directory via:

./configure --prefix=<mykde3base>


If configure was successful just compile K3b:

make

Now you are ready to install:

make install (as root)


K3b needs some special permission settings to work properly.
With K3b comes the K3bSetup Wizard that will perform all the necessary steps.
Just start it.


Have fun
