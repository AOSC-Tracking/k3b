Install K3b 0.4.2
-----------------

K3b 0.4.2 requires the ID3Lib which can be downloaded from id3lib.sourceforge.net.
First you need to install (configure/make/make install) the id3lib.

Then install K3b like every other KDE app:

./configure

make

make install (as root)



To work properly cdrecord, cdrdao and mkisofs need root privileges.
To do this you could either run k3b as root or do some additionel work:

This is how I configured my system:
	cdrecord, cdrdao, mkisofs are all part of the group "cdrecording" and owned by root:
	This can be done by (as root for cdrecord): 
		"chgrp cdrecording cdrecord"
		"chown root cdrecord"

	Then they are set suid root which means that they will be executed with
	root privileges. This is done as follows: 
		"chmod 4710 cdrecord"

This configuration is based on the cdrecord-man-page.

Since K3b 0.4.2 has a new CD-Device-Management-System which needs access to the sgX devices
you need to either run K3b as root (bad) or gain write-access to the /dev/sgX devices (less bad).
This could be done as root by typing the following commands (using the same group as above):

	chgrp cdrecording /dev/sg*
	chmod g+rw /dev/sg*

Sorry for that, but now K3b is able to detect the speed of most drives and if they support BURN-PROOF.

Have fun
