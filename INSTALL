Install K3b 0.5
-----------------

K3b 0.5 requires the ID3Lib which can be downloaded from id3lib.sourceforge.net and the cdparanoia devel package
which should be included in every current distribution.


After installing ID3Lib and cdparanoia devel install K3b like every other KDE app:

./configure

make

make install (as root)


K3b needs some special permission settings to work properly.
With 0.5.2 comes the K3bSetup Wizard that will perform all the necessary steps.
No need to do anything on your own!

Have fun
