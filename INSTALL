Installing K3b 0.12
-------------------


What you need to run K3b:
 - since K3b is a CD writing program a cd writer would be a good thing to have ;-)
 - the QT3 library (at least version 3.2)
 - the KDE3 libraries (at least version 3.2)
 - optionally the kdemultimedia package is needed for the K3b audioplayer to work.
 - the cdparanoia library for cd ripping from Monty
 - the cdrtools (cdrecord, mkisofs) from Joerg Schilling
 - cdrdao, the other linux cd writing program from Andreas Mueller
 - the dvd+rw-tools by Andy Polyakov for DVD writing
 - optional the transcode tools for DVD ripping and DivX/XviD encoding from Thomas Oestreich
 - optional vcdimager >= 0.7 for creating video cds
 - optional libmad for mp3 decoding
 - optional ogg-vorbis libraries for encoding and decoding
 - optional the FLAC++ libraries for flac-decoding
 - optional the eMovix package
 - optional TagLib by Scott Wheeler for reading Meta data tags


After that it's all the same:

./configure

or try ./configure --help to learn about the options.

If configure was successful just compile K3b:

make

Now you are ready to install:

make install (as root)


See PERMISSIONS on hints how to properly setup the permissions to use K3b without problems.


Have fun
