Installing K3b 0.11
-------------------


Before installing K3b please make sure you have at least the following installed on your system:
 - the QT3 library (at least version 3.1)
 - the KDE3 libraries (at least version 3.1)
 


After that it's all the same:

./configure

or try ./configure --help to learn about the options.
Most likely you will have to set the kde3 directory via:

./configure --prefix=`kde-config --prefix`


If configure was successful just compile K3b:

make

Now you are ready to install:

make install (as root)


K3b needs some special permission settings to work properly.
With K3b comes the K3bSetup2 KControlModule ehich can perform all the necessary steps.
Just give it a try.


Have fun
