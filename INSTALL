Installing K3b 0.11
-------------------


What you need to run K3b:
 - since K3b is a CD writing program a cd writer would be a good thing to have ;-)
 - the QT3 library (at least version 3.1)
 - the KDE3 libraries (at least version 3.1)
 - optionally the kdemultimedia package is needed for the K3b audioplayer to work.
 - the cdparanoia library for cd ripping from Monty
 - the cdrtools (cdrecord, mkisofs) from Joerg Schilling
 - cdrdao, the other linux cd writing program from Andreas Mueller
 - the dvd+rw-tools by Andy Polyakov for DVD writing
 - optional the transcode tools for DVD ripping and DivX/XviD encoding from Thomas Oestreich
 - optional vcdimager >= 0.7 for creating video cds
 - optional libmad for mp3 decoding
 - optional ogg-vorbis libraries for encoding and decoding
 - optional the FLAC++ libraries for flac-decoding
 - optional the eMovix package



After that it's all the same:

./configure

or try ./configure --help to learn about the options.

If configure was successful just compile K3b:

make

Now you are ready to install:

make install (as root)



Setting the proper permissions
------------------------------

K3b needs some special permission settings to work properly.

With K3b comes the K3bSetup2 KControlModule which can perform all the necessary steps
on systems which do not use devfs/udev or where devfs/udev are configured to save permission
changes.

In case you want to setup the permissions manually here is what needs to be done.
1. K3b needs write access to all the CD/DVD drives' block devices.
   The most simple way is to do a
      chmod 666 /dev/...
   on all CD/DVD block devices.
   For IDE/ATAPI drives the block devices are /dev/hdX or /dev/ide/hostX/busX/targetX/lunX/cd when
   using devfs/udev.
   For SCSI drives the block devices are /dev/scdX (or /dev/srX) or /dev/scsi/hostX/busX/targetX/lunX/cd
   when using devfs/udev.

2. In case you have scsi devices or use the ide-scsi emulation make sure you also have write
   access to the generic devices /dev/sgX or /dev/scsi/hostX/busX/targetX/lunX/generic when using devfs/udev
   which belong to your writers.
   (These permission are not needed by K3b directly but by cdrecord.)

3. Although it is not nessessary it is recommended to run cdrecord suid root. That way cdrecord 
   will run with a high priority which increases the burning process stability. Additionally it is
   only possible to change the fifo buffer when cdrecord is run with root privileges.
   The most simple way is
      chmod 4711 /usr/bin/cdrecord
   (You may also create a special cdwriting group and restrict all the above permissions to that group.)




Have fun
