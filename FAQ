Q: When writing an audio cd K3b canceles with the following message:
   "No cdrdao driver found."
A: K3b is not able to determine the cdrdao driver for your writer automatically. Please set it
   manually in K3b's device settings (not K3bSetup) (for most current drives it would be 'generic-mmc').


Q: I cannot select my IDE CDROM as reading device in the cd copy dialog.
A: K3b currently does only support SCSI devices for cd copy. To use your IDE CDROM for 
   reading please enable SCSI emulation.


Q: Compiling K3b fails with errors like this:
   base_k3badvanceddataimagesettings.cpp:185: invalid use of undefined type 
   `struct KComboBox'
   base_k3badvanceddataimagesettings.h:17: forward declaration of `struct 
   KComboBox'
A: The QTDesigner tool 'uic' is not able to find the kde widget plugins. 
   To solve this run 'qtconfig' and add '$KDEDIR/lib/kde3/plugins' to the plugin search path 
   (replace $KDEDIR with your kde base dir).


Q: K3b thinks my SCSI device is IDE.
A: If you are using the rpm from SuSE your version of K3bSetup is not able to set the
   permissions that K3b needs the devices to have. The SuSE guys seem to think messing with 
   permissions is too dangerous. It is recommended to always compile from source to have all 
   K3b features.


Q: Everytime K3b starts it asks for K3bSetup to be run although I completed it.
A: Most likely you installed K3b in the wrong directory. All KDE programs are installed in the 
   KDE dirtree (SuSE: /opt/kde3, RedHat: /usr). If you compile K3b from source it defaults 
   to either $KDEDIR or /usr/local (which is strange since /opt/kde3 should be the default; but this is part of
   the KDE build system). To install in the correct directory you need to specify the prefix to configure
   like this:
     ./configure --prefix=/opt/kde3
   That will install K3b relative to /opt/kde3.
