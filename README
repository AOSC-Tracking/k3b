K3b Version 0.5

Thanx for downloading my very first KDE-project.

With version 0.5 K3b becomes a grown-up program.
These are the features:
   - the most userfriendly interface ever ;-)
	- writing audio-cds from mp3 and wav files (on-the-fly or with images)
   	 - cd-text support
       - ID3-tag support
       - little gimmick: hide the first track (so that you have to search back from the beginning of the cd to find it)
	- writing ISO-cds
       - Joliet/Rockridge support
       - create image/write image
       - writing on-the-fly
	    - creating of file-tree via drag'n'drop (as easy as it could be)
            - removing files and directories from data tree
            - adding new empty directories to data tree
            - renaming of files (manually or automatically for mp3-files) (for joliet and rockrigde)
	    - support for most of the mkisofs-options (I don't think anyone will ever use them! ;-))
   - writing existing iso-images
   - blanking of cdrws
   - cd ripping to wav
        - cddb support
        - sophisticated pattern system to automatically organize the ripped tracks
   - cd writing in the backgroud
   - K3b checks if the user inserted an empty disk (I think K3b is the only program under linux with that feature!)
   - Retrieving cd info and toc
   - Support for ATAPI drives without SCSI-emulation for reading

Please, please report bugs (with k3b output!) and tell me what you like/dislike
about the user-interface!

Have fun
