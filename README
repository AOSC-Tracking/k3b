K3b Version 0.4.1

Thanx for downloading my very first KDE-project.

Since this is an alpha version some things might not work correct!
This is what should work so far:
	- burning audio-cds from mp3 and wav files. Sorry, still no track-length. :-(
	- cd-text (with ID3-tag support)
	- burning ISO-cds (with Joliet/Rockridge) (create image/write image or writing on-the-fly)
	- creating of file-tree via drag'n'drop
	- renaming of files (manually or automatically for mp3-files)
	- support for most of the mkisofs-options (I don't think anyone will ever use them! ;-))

Hint: Since there is no option to create folders in an iso-project yet drag an empty dir to your project and rename
	it to create a new folder. I will add this option in the next release.

Please, please report bugs (with k3b output!) and tell me what you like/dislike 
about the user-interface!

Have fun
