What you need to run K3b:
 - since K3b is a CD writing program a cd writer would be a good thing to have ;-)
 - the QT3 and KDE3 (at least kdelibs and kdemultimedia) libraries from the good guys
 - the cdparanoia library for cd ripping from Monty
 - the cdrtools (cdrecord, mkisofs) from Joerg Schilling
 - cdrdao, the other linux cd writing program from Andreas Mueller
 - optional the transcode tools for DVD ripping and DivX/XviD encoding from Thomas Oestreich
 - optional vcdimager >= 0.7 for creating video cds

See INSTALL for further information


Please report bugs (with k3b output!) and tell me what you like/dislike
about the user-interface!

Have fun
