K3b Version 0.7

Thanx for downloading K3b - The CD Kreator

These are the features so far:
 - the most userfriendly interface ever ;-)

 - writing audio-cds
   - from mp3, ogg vorbis, and wav files (on-the-fly or with images)
   - cd-text support
   - ID3-tag support
   - little gimmick: hide the first track (so that you have to search back from the beginning of the cd to find it)

 - writing ISO-cds
   - Joliet/Rockridge support
   - create image/write image
   - writing on-the-fly
   - creating of file-tree via drag'n'drop (as easy as it could be)
   - removing files and directories from data tree
   - moving files within the project
   - adding new empty directories to data tree
   - renaming of files (manually or automatically for mp3-files) (for joliet and rockrigde)
   - support for most of the mkisofs-options (I don't think anyone will ever use them! ;-))
   - multisession support

 - writing existing iso-images to cd

 - cd copy (data, audio, mixed mode)

 - blanking of cdrws

 - cd ripping to wav
   - cddb support
   - sophisticated pattern system to automatically organize the ripped tracks

 - dvd ripping with the transcode tools

 - K3b checks if the user inserted an empty disk

 - Retrieving cd info and toc

 - Support for ATAPI drives without SCSI-emulation for reading

 - integrated full featured audio player


What you need to run K3b:
 - since K3b is a CD writing program a cd writer would be a good thing to have ;-)
 - the QT3 and KDE3 libraries from the good guys
 - the cdparanoia library for cd ripping from Monty
 - the cdrtools (cdrecord, mkisofs) from Joerg Schilling
 - cdrdao, the other linux cd writing program from Andreas Mueller
 - optional the transcode tools for DVD ripping from Thomas Oestreich

See INSTALL for further information


Please report bugs (with k3b output!) and tell me what you like/dislike
about the user-interface!

Have fun
