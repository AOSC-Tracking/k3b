K3b Version 0.3

Thanx for downloading my very first KDE-project.

Things that should work so far:

- burning audio cds from wav and mp3-files (cd-text seems not to work since there is still a problem with cdrdao)
- Configuring external programs
- Configuring devices

I hope this little :-) program will help you to create some cds under KDE.
