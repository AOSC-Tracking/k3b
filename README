K3b Version 0.4.3

Thanx for downloading my very first KDE-project.

Since this is an early version some things might not work correct!
This is what should work so far:
	- burning audio-cds from mp3 and wav files.
	- cd-text (with ID3-tag support)
	- burning ISO-cds (with Joliet/Rockridge) (create image/write image or writing on-the-fly)
	- creating of file-tree via drag'n'drop
	- renaming of files (manually or automatically for mp3-files)
	- support for most of the mkisofs-options (I don't think anyone will ever use them! ;-))

Please, please report bugs (with k3b output!) and tell me what you like/dislike
about the user-interface!

Have fun
